## Additional Notes

- Students should demonstrate proficiency in working with both raster and vector data in a spatial context.
- Code should be concise, supported by text and follow best practices for readability and efficiency.
- Visualizations should effectively communicate key findings from the data analysis.
- The GitHub repository should be professional, well-organized, and include all necessary files for reproducing the analysis.
